The World Bank visited with the GSS from November 4th - 15th to provide geospatial training, advice, and tools to improve efficiency in the EA delineation process currently being undertaken.

As part of that intervention, the World Bank team developed a number of specific tools for improving efficiency with a particular focus on editing and map creation.

The training for the program can mostly be found in the training folder, while each automation improvement is found in its own folder
